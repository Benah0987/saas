AB  - Ticks are arachnid ectoparasites that rank second only to mosquitoes in the 
      transmission of human diseases including bacteria responsible for anaplasmosis, 
      ehrlichiosis, spotted fevers, and Lyme disease among other febrile illnesses. Due 
      to the paucity of data on bacteria transmitted by ticks in Kenya, this study 
      undertook a bacterial metagenomic-based characterization of ticks collected from 
      Isiolo, a semi-arid pastoralist County in Eastern Kenya, and Kwale, a coastal 
      County with a monsoon climate in the southern Kenyan border with Tanzania. A 
      total of 2,918 ticks belonging to 3 genera and 10 species were pooled and 
      screened in this study. Tick identification was confirmed through the sequencing 
      of the Cytochrome C Oxidase Subunit 1 (COI) gene. Bacterial 16S rRNA gene PCR 
      amplicons obtained from the above samples were sequenced using the MinION (Oxford 
      Nanopore Technologies) platform. The resulting reads were demultiplexed in 
      Porechop, followed by trimming and filtering in Trimmomatic before clustering 
      using Qiime2-VSearch. A SILVA database pretrained na√Øve Bayes classifier was used 
      to classify the Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) taxonomically. The bacteria of 
      clinical interest detected in pooled tick assays were as follows: Rickettsia spp. 
      59.43% of pools, Coxiella burnetii 37.88%, Proteus mirabilis 5.08%, Cutibacterium 
      acnes 6.08%, and Corynebacterium ulcerans 2.43%. These bacteria are responsible 
      for spotted fevers, query fever (Q-fever), urinary tract infections, skin and 
      soft tissue infections, eye infections, and diphtheria-like infections in humans, 
      respectively. P. mirabilis, C. acnes, and C. ulcerans were detected only in 
      Isiolo. Additionally, COI sequences allowed for the identification of Rickettsia 
      and Coxiella species to strain levels in some of the pools. Diversity analysis 
      revealed that the tick genera had high levels of Alpha diversity but the 
      differences between the microbiomes of the three tick genera studied were not 
      significant. The detection of C. acnes, commonly associated with human skin flora 
      suggests that the ticks may have contact with humans potentially exposing them to 
      bacterial infections. The findings in this study highlight the need for further 
      investigation into the viability of these bacteria and the competency of ticks to 
      transmit them. Clinicians in these high-risk areas also need to be appraised for 
      them to include Rickettsial diseases and Q-fever as part of their differential 
      diagnosis.
